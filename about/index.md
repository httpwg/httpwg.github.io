The **HTTP Working Group** (a.k.a. HTTPbis) is part of the [IETF](http://www.ietf.org/), an internet standards-setting organization.

Our mandate and scope of work is outlined in our [charter](http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/charter/).

You can learn more about participating in the IETF by reading [The Tao of the IETF](http://www.ietf.org/tao.html).

## Meetings

We meet face-to-face at most IETF meetings, and sometimes hold additional "interim" meetings; related materials from past and upcoming meetings can be found in our [meeting materials repository](https://github.com/httpwg/wg-materials).

During our official meetings, we use an [XMPP (Jabber) channel](xmpp://httpbis@jabber.ietf.org?join) (​[archives](http://www.ietf.org/jabber/logs/httpbis/)) provided by the IETF.

## Participate

As with all IETF Working Groups, almost all discussion and decisions are made on our [mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/). Joining this list is "joining" the Working Group, and is the best way to participate.

You can track our [current efforts](/wip/) on this site, as well as in our [github repositories](https://github.com/httpwg/).

ALL contributors and participants in the Working Group (i.e., on the mailing list and in physical meetings) MUST read and understand the ​[NOTE WELL](http://www.ietf.org/about/note-well.html) statement.
